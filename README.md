## Building from Source
You need Java 1.8 

### Building
Just invoke the build at the root of the project
```
$ ./mvnw clean install
```

### Running the app locally
Once you have built the library, you can easily start the app as any other Spring Boot app from the root directory:
```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
